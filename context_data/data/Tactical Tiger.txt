Based on your Tactical Tiger traits, here are our recommendations to help you make sound financial decisions. 
	1. Engage with instruments that feed your curiosity and hunger for growth. These could be equity instruments (both domestic and international), alternative investments like commercial real estate, REITs, etc. or new-age products like cryptocurrencies and P2P lending.

	3. Use your methodical approach to your advantage by committing to a framework that allows you to review your finances periodically.

This bias might convince you to underestimate risks and overestimate returns, which would lead to a highly concentrated portfolio.
