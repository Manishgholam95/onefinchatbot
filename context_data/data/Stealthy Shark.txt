How many or What are the Stealthy Shark recommendations/suggestions ?
Based on your Stealthy Shark traits, here are our recommendations to help you make sound financial decisions. 
	1. Choose financial instruments that feed your curiosity and hunger for growth. These could include equity instruments (both domestic and international), alternative investments like commercial real estate, REITs, etc. or new-age products like cryptocurrencies, P2P lending, asset financing and the like.
	2. Try not to over-diversify, and avoid devoting vast portions of your portfolio to very risky asset classes. Opt for long-term investment products only if you think you can remain committed to them for extended periods, and maintain adequate liquidity at all times.
	3. Leverage your organisational skills to build a framework for managing and reviewing your finances periodically.


How many or What are the stealthy shark behavioural bias ?
We have also identified some behavioural biases that youâ€™re likely to display while making financial decisions, and should be conscious of:

1)Overconfidence Bias:

This bias might convince you to underestimate risks and overestimate returns, which would lead to a highly concentrated portfolio.
