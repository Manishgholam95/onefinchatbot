How many or What are the Far-sighted Eagle recommendations/suggestions ?
Based on your Far-sighted Eagle traits, here are our recommendations to help you make sound financial decisions. 
	1. You can explore financial instruments that feed your ambition and appetite for risk — these could be equity instruments (both domestic and international), alternative investments like commercial real estate, REITs, etc. or new-age products like cryptocurrencies or P2P lending. Make sure you understand the risk/reward profiles of these instruments completely before venturing into them.
	2. Given your meticulous and strategic approach to money matters, using loans to build long-term assets might be a good option.
	3. Refrain from investing in certain asset classes just because your peers are doing it — do your own research before taking the plunge.
	4. Given your foresight and planning skills, creating a framework to review your finances from time-to-time would be of great help.

How many or What are the Far-sighted Eagle behavioural bias ?
We also identified some behavioural biases that you’re likely to display while making financial decisions, and should be conscious of:

This bias might convince you to underestimate risks and overestimate returns, which would lead to a highly concentrated portfolio.
